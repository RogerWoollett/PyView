PyView.py

This program shows system data in a number of views. One shows static system information. Two scrolling views show cpu and memory usage.
The program was developed for raspberry pi but should work on other platforms.
You will need to install the import library psutils to use this program.
All testing has used python 3.2 but it should work on python 2.7
To use place all files in the same directory (PythonView.py,osview.py,cpuview.py,memview.py,graph.py) then execute PyView.py (python3 Pyview.py)
